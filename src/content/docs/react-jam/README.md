React Jam is an online event where React developers come together to create games in 12 days.

The first four instances of this event all had an additional challenge from a sponsor: "Multiplayer Challenge by Rune". This challenge required developers to use the Rune SDK and achieve the highest playtime out of the competition during a specified window of time, and that window of time is typically after the jam submission deadline has passed.

# Per-Event Information

As a personal note, this northern-hemisphere-defaultism is stupid. As someone living in the southern hemisphere, I won't call a game jam starting in December a "Winter Jam". We can't even be like GGJ and title the instance as a year number, since multiple of these jams occur per year. 

So, the events will be numbered, like Ludum Dare.
