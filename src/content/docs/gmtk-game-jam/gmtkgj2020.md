#### *Further rules:*

- You may participate in two jams at once if they happen at the same time and your game will fit both themes.
- Games submitted to the GMTK Jam must not contain nudity, or hateful language or visuals.
- You may make a VR game, but consider that few people will have the tech to actually judge your game.
- You can support other platforms (such as Mac and Android) if you wish, provided there's at least one Windows / browser build
- Your game cannot require additional software such as an emulator, or a game like Super Mario Maker 2, Roblox, or Dreams.
- You may re-use some small bits of code, such as controller support. Use your best judgement, as mods will not be able to advise you on this.

#### *Legal bit:*

- Anything you make during the GMTK Game Jam is your property. GMTK claims no rights or ownership of your game. 
- Any game submitted to the GMTK Game Jam may show up in a GMTK YouTube video without your express permission.
