### Overview

Yeehaw! Get ready to saddle up and dust off those old boots 'cause it's time for a good ol' fashioned code rodeo! 

This year SXSW Sydney is running its first ever Game Jam as part of the 2024 Games Festival. We want to hone in on the creative spirit of game developers and feature the incredible work within the games industry. 

Teams will be provided with a theme to develop their game and asked to develop this over 30 days. Ten projects shortlisted from among the entries will each win two Games Badges to attend SXSW Sydney.

The shortlisted games will be showcased one night during the SXSW Sydney Games Festival which runs 16 October - 20 October 2024.

The SXSW Sydney 2024 CowboyJam will be run remotely between August 1- August 31 2024.

### Theme

The theme of SXSW Sydney 2024's CowboyJam should be obvious, but in case you need it spelled out for you, the theme is: 

#### ðŸ¤ ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ **COWBOYS** ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ¤ 

You can interpret this how you like! You could treat it as wild western theming, recontextualise a cowboy to a new setting or even just put a cowboy hat on something. Have fun with the theming and use it to inspire something unique  and left of field. 

### Criteria & Judging

Entries for the 2024 SXSW Sydney Game Jam will be scored on the following criteria:

- **Innovation**: Is your game mechanically interesting or explore gameplay in an innovative way? 
- **Polish**: Does your game feel smooth and intuitive? Does it look and sound great? 
- **Execution of Theme**: Does your game meaningfully or creatively interpret the theme? 

Based on this criteria, shortlisted games will be hand-picked by our fabulous guest judge [Siobhan Dent](https://siobhan-dent.itch.io/) in conjunction with the SXSW Sydney Games Team.
