The SXSW Sydney Game Jam slithers in for 2025!

The shortlisted games will be showcased one night during the SXSW Sydney Games Festival which runs 15 October - 18 October 2025.

#### üêçüêçüêç THEME: SNAKE üêçüêçüêç

In honour of the Lunar Calendar year and a little piece of mobile gaming history, this year's theme is **SNAKE**!

You can interpret this how you like! Whether you take the theme literally or figuratively is up to you. See where your inspiration takes you, treat SNAKE as a starting point, not an ironclad theme.
