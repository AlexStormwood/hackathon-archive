# Ludum Dare

For the sake of this repository, we'll just keep the Ludum Dare dates & themes in a table here.

I (Bigfoot/Alex) haven't personally participated in these so I don't know if I'm missing additional info (eg. for comparison: Global Game Jam has a huge variety of modifiers per event, LD doesn't seem to do that?) but it looks like there's not really much info to archive per event when it comes to the event theme itself.

## Rules

If this info exists, it is not available as of 13th April 2024; [https://ludumdare.com/resources/rules](https://ludumdare.com/resources/rules)

## Per-Event Theme Information

This information is lifted from Wikipedia and trimmed down for focus;
